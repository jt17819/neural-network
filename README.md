# Exploring Nerual Networks
A personal project for me to write my own nerual network implementing foward and back propagation, gradient descent, batching and shuffling.

## Overview
This project implements a neural network in Python to recognize hand-drawn digits (0-9). The system uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on the MNIST dataset to classify digit images with high accuracy.

## Features
Neural network implementation from scratch (using NumPy)

Trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training samples)

Tested on 10,000 validation samples

Achieves ~95% accuracy on test data

Supports loading custom hand-drawn digit images for prediction

## Requirements
* Python 3.10+

* NumPy

* Dill

* OpenCV

* Pillow
